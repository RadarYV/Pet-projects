# Forecasting taxi orders

The company "An awesome taxi" collected historical data on taxi orders at airports. To attract more drivers during peak load, you need to predict the number of taxi orders for the next hour.


## Task
Build a model for such a prediction. 
Train different models with different hyperparameters. Make a test sample of 10% of the original data.
Check the data on the test sample and draw conclusions.

## Data
The data is in the file 'taxi.csv'. The number of orders is in the num_orders column
